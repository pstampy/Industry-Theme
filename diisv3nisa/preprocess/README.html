<h1 id="defining-preprocess-hooks">Defining preprocess hooks</h1>
<p>Rather than placing your preprocess hooks directly in the template.php file you
can manage them in automatically discovered and lazy-loaded include files. It is
even possible to organize them in sub-folders. This feature greatly improves the
maintainability of large themes that would otherwise contain hundreds of lines
of unrelated code in your template.php file.</p>
<p>The include files have to follow a certain naming pattern (HOOK.preprocess.inc)
for them to be automatically discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>THEMENAME_preprocess_html() = html.preprocess.inc</li>
<li>THEMENAME_preprocess_page() = page.preprocess.inc</li>
<li>THEMENAME_preprocess_node() = node.preprocess.inc</li>
<li>THEMENAME_preprocess_comment() = comment.preprocess.inc</li>
<li>THEMENAME_preprocess_region() = region.preprocess.inc</li>
</ul>
<p>As with template files, you should replace underscores from the hook names with
hyphens:</p>
<ul>
<li>THEMENAME_preprocess_comment_wrapper() = comment-wrapper.preprocess.inc</li>
<li>THEMENAME_preprocess_html_tag() = html-tag.preprocess.inc</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside of each of these files you define the preprocess hook just as you would
otherwise do in your template.php file:</p>
<pre><code>function THEMENAME_preprocess_HOOK(&amp;$variables) {
  // Your code here.
}
</code></pre>
