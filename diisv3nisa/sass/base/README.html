<p>Base styles define the default look for HTML and, to some extent, common Drupal
elements.</p>
<p>These rules will generally be made up of element selectors for HTML elements
such as headings, paragraphs and lists. Common Drupal elements, such as basic
form items, should be covered as well.</p>
<p>The styleguide module (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/styleguide">http://drupal.org/project/styleguide</a>) gives you a good
overview of common Drupal elements for styling. By setting a solid baseline
before adding any more specific customisations you ensure that as any new
features are added they will be correctly styled without any extra work.</p>
